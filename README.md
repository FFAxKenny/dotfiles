Kenny Luong - DotFiles!
===================

This repository contains my configuration files for various programs
as well as some simple/misc scripts for things. It's nothing really 
formal; things are added and removed as I feel a need to have a feature
in a program.

Feel free to browse, comment and/or fork.


## Installation
